## Growth Mindset

My name is *Jessica Porter* , I am a future software engineer... to see any of my current works here is a link to my [github](https://github.com/) .

*Growth Mindset*


To have a **growth mindset** is to know you need *improvement* and to work/seek to grow in any area whether it be physically, mentally and spirtually..


Three reminders to myself to continue to grow : 
1.**Seek feedback**
2.Continue to *learn* new things
3.**Be kind to yourself.**
