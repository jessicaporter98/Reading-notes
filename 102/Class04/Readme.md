# Creating a website with HTML
  ## Wireframing 

  
**Wireframing** - Wireframing is how *UX designers* plan out and design the layout of the website before actually creating the website.

When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code.


*Wireframes* drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.


With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. 
Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.


Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

Here are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
Sketch > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

**keep user in mind**
