## Text editors
Text editors are a piece of software  that allows you to write and manage text that you write to build a web site.


## I**Important features** when choosing a editor  are:


1. code completion;
2. syntax highlighting; 
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue);
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them

 ( *Extensions* are like
plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that
you wouldnâ€™t have otherwise.)



A **command line**, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. 

You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The *command line* typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

**File:** obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

Everything is a *file* under Linux.

*Relative path* is A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
*Absolute path* is A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
