# Javascript 

**Javascript** JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight compiled programming language with first-class functions.

**JavaScript** is a multi-paradigm, 
dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods.

 Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. 
 *JavaScript* supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes and classes. 
 It also supports functional programming since functions are first-class that can be easily created via expressions and passed around like any other objec

*JavaScript's* dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection 
(via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).

Do not confuse **JavaScript** with the **Java** programming language — **JavaScript** is not "Interpreted Java". Both "*Java*" and "*JavaScript*" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries.

 However, the two programming languages have very different *syntax*, *semantics*, and use.

 **JavaScript** offers seven primitive types:

**Number**: used for all number values (integer and floating point) except for very big integers.
**BigInt**: used for arbitrarily large integers.
**String**: used to store text.
**Boolean**: true and false — usually used for conditional logic.
**Symbol**: used for creating unique identifiers that won't collide.
**Undefined**: indicating that a variable has not been assigned a value.
*Null**: indicating a deliberate non-value.
Everything else is known as an Object. 

Common object types include:
**Function**
**Array**
**Date**
**RegExp**
**Error**

Numbers

*JavaScript* has two built-in numeric types: 
*Number*
* BigInt.*
