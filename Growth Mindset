## Growth Mindset

My name is Jessica Porter , I am a future software engineer, here is a link to my [github](https://github.com/)
To have a **growth mindset** is to know you need *improvement* and to work to grow in any area whether it be physically, mentally and spirtually.


Three reminders to myself : 
1.Seek feedback
2.Continue to learn new things
3.Be kind to yourself.
